You know, when they use reality TV, they try to change what actually happens a little bit so that it&#8217;s more interesting.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism at Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland, in collaboration with the university\u2019s Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement and the Washington Post, <a href=\"https://cdce.umd.edu/feature/new-washington-post%E2%80%93umd-poll-shows-increase-concerns-over-sports-betting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">conducted a national poll of 1,032 adults</a>. The online poll from December 4-7 gathered opinions about the growing influence of the sports gambling industry \u2013 and its impact on the outcome of the games.</p>\n<p>Fifty-six percent of Americans are confident that professional sports in the U.S. are played competitively and that outcomes aren\u2019t influenced by gambling, according to the poll.</p>\n<p>Of 1,032 U.S. adults polled, only 11% said they were very confident. Forty-six percent said they were somewhat confident, while 32% said that they were \u201cnot too confident\u201d and 12% reported that they weren\u2019t at all confident.</p>\n<p>People who watch sports more often were more confident that outcomes aren\u2019t influenced by gambling. Sixty-three percent of people who reported that they watch sports monthly or more often were confident that outcomes weren\u2019t influenced by gambling compared to 48% of people who said that they don\u2019t watch sports monthly.</p>\n<p>Adults aged 18-34 \u2013 the study\u2019s most active gamblers, with 24% of respondents in that range reported having placed a bet in the past five years \u2013 were confident in the integrity of professional sports in the U.S..</p>\n<p>Of all respondents, those 65 and older were most confident that professional sports in the U.S. involve outcomes not influenced by gambling. In that group, 67% said that they were very or somewhat confident in the integrity of professional sports.</p>\n<p>Diane Davis, a retired Silicon Valley worker, said that she was around \u201c50 percent\u201d confident that the outcomes of professional sports in the U.S. aren\u2019t influenced by gambling.</p>\n<p>However, she was more confident in the belief that sports gambling\u2019s rapid growth continuing will lead to more outcomes being influenced by gambling \u2013 especially with football players.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe length of their careers is short,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI worked for 40 years. They&#8217;re not working for 40 years, which is reflected in the fact that they get paid a lot, because they&#8217;re not going to be able to do it forever, but it would again be another incentive for them to, you know, make money while they can.\u201d</p>\n<p>Prop bets or micro bets \u2013 different bet types that involve individual players or focus on specific events occurring during sporting contests \u2013 have been prominent in many recent sports betting scandals.</p>\n<p>In Major League Baseball, two Cleveland Guardians pitchers \u2013 one a three-time All-Star \u2013 were suspended and indicted on federal charges having been accused of rigging individual pitches. Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier, who has played ten years in the National Basketball Association, were arrested and charged in gambling cases involving alleged insider betting and rigged poker games.</p>\n<p>Chris Yost, who is semi-retired and lives in Alabama who previously owned various businesses, stated that he doesn\u2019t have a strong opinion on online sports betting in general, but is strongly against prop bets.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt sets up the sport to be tampered with,\u201d Yost said. \u201cI feel like it does open the door to possibly get athletes to maybe affect the outcome of the game for money.\u201d</p>\n<p>National Collegiate Athletic Association President Charlie Baker has been outspoken against prop bets in college sports since his appointment in March 2023. Now 15 states ban prop bets with several others having restrictions.</p>\n<p>Sixty percent of respondents in the Povich Center-CDCE-Washington Post poll believe that prop bets are likely to lead to sporting events being fixed or rigged. Older respondents were the group with the most consistent belief that prop bets will likely lead to fixed sporting events \u2013 66% of respondents 65 or older put that it was either very likely or somewhat likely, compared to only 57% of respondents aged 18-34.</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel like the athletes probably would have less guilt,\u201d Yost said regarding prop bets. \u201cI&#8217;m concerned doing that \u2013 doing something on a single play, not affecting the overall outcome of the game or their season, or anything else \u2013 that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m against proposition betting.\u201d</p>\n",

Gold piping weaves down both side seams completing the vintage look.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s something almost old school about it, \u2026 which I think is the way that football shirts should go now because some of the modern designs are a bit less inspiring,\u201d store supervisor Paul Becha said.</p>\n<p>The kit\u2019s simplistic colors lend themselves to functionality \u2014 an important aspect when buying any clothes. Becha said he\u2019d likely style the shirt with a black zip-up jacket, black corduroy pants, and white Adidas Gazelle sneakers.</p>\n<p>Becha also described D.C. United&#8217;s third kit as one of the shop\u2019s most popular MLS jerseys.</p>\n<p>All Inter Miami shirts with Lionel Messi\u2019s name on it tend to be top-sellers as well, given his status as arguably the greatest soccer player of all time. Becha also said the Columbus Crew\u2019s glow-in-the-dark Goosebumps-inspired kit receives ample attention \u2014 mostly due to novelty.</p>\n<p>Becha estimated around 200 MLS kits get sold per month, with the D.C. United being the most popular club. American shoppers, whom the store receives regularly, typically seek teams outside the States though.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey want your Arsenals, Chelseas, Barcelonas, Real Madrids, Manchester Uniteds. Then you\u2019ll get the rogue people who are like, \u2018I want a Leighton Orient jersey,\u2019\u201d Becha said. \u201cWe get more requests from non-Americans for MLS stuff than we do from Americans.\u201d</p>\n<p>On the women\u2019s side, Washington Spirit and other National Women\u2019s Soccer League teams aren\u2019t featured at Classic Football Shirts London, but Becha said the demand for women\u2019s kits is growing. It also seems like a natural progression, as Alex Morgan <a href=\"https://www.sportico.com/business/commerce/2024/alex-morgan-mcelhenney-wasserman-classic-football-shirts-1234796982/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">is an investor in the Classic Football Shirts brand</a>.</p>\n<p>The U.S. women\u2019s national team legend <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79OEUmiLe8Y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">also featured on YouTuber Ellis Platten\u2019s shirt-shopping series</a>, in which he interviews famed soccer-related guests while helping them shop for classic kits. Most episodes are filmed at Classic Football Shirts London, and get replayed on the screens hanging on the store\u2019s walls.</p>\n<p>The popularity of Platten\u2019s series continues to bring the sport\u2019s best fashion-based stories into the limelight, through social media.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a way for us to advertise this place being here rather than just doing traditional marketing,\u201d Becha said. \u201cMaybe every third or fourth customer has come here and referenced [Platten\u2019s videos].\u201d</p>\n",

            "rendered": "<p>LONDON \u2014 As the Jacksonville Jaguars and Buffalo Bills got ready for their Jan. 11 matchup in the wild-card round of the NFL playoffs, Charlie Nelson had a problem.</p>\n<p>Nelson is vice president of the London Bills Backers, a group that regularly hosts watch parties at the cozy Fitzrovia Belle pub in the capital of the United Kingdom. For the playoff game, the Bills Backers were allocated 140 tickets to the pub due to space limitations and sent out a sign-up form on the morning of Jan. 5.</p>\n<p>Less than 24 hours later, all 140 were taken.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been turning people away all day,\u201d Nelson said the day of the game. \u201cWe can only fit so many people in.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Bills Backers started as a group of about a dozen fans looking for people to cheer with. Soon after they started, the Bills made the 2019-20 playoffs. Even though the team lost in the first round to the Texans, that game showed the London Bills Backers what their organization could become.</p>\n<p>Six years later, the group takes over the Fitzrovia Belle every NFL Sunday.</p>\n<p>One step inside the Belle, and it\u2019s clear why capacity can become an issue. The two-room bar is packed shoulder-to-shoulder with Bills fans from around the country and world.</p>\n<p>Palmer grew up about two hours east of London. The Super Bowl was one of the only games broadcasted in the United Kingdom when he was a child in the \u201990s. He fell in love with Jim Kelly-led Bills, who lost four of them in a row between 1991 and 1994.</p>\n<p>Decades later, Palmer is far from the only British Bills fan traveling multiple hours for the playoff matchup.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt feels like home,\u201d Palmer said. \u201cThey\u2019re just my sort of people.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Bills made the playoffs each of the past five seasons. All five postseasons were ended by either the Kansas City Chiefs or the Cincinnati Bengals. With neither of those teams there to stop them in the 2025-26 playoffs, confidence was high Sunday night at the Fitzrovia Belle.</p>\n<p>But that optimistic energy quickly turned into nerves. The Bills led by one score throughout the second and third quarters, until a six-yard touchdown pass from Trevor Lawrence to Parker Washington gave Jacksonville a 16-13 lead early in the final frame.</p>\n<p>Buffalo responded with a touchdown of its own on the ensuing drive. But a 10-play, 77-yard touchdown drive by Jacksonville meant the Bills trailed by four points with 4:03 left in regulation.</p>\n<p>That drive was catapulted by a 31-yard deep ball by, once again, Washington. The 5-foot-10 slot receiver finished the game with seven catches for 107 yards \u2014 and drew a plethora of profanity-laced jeers from the Bills faithful.</p>\n<p>But hope wasn\u2019t dead. There was 4:03 left on the clock for Josh Allen, a man who\u2019s become the Bills\u2019 biggest folk hero in decades. One look at the back wall of the Fitzrovia Belle cements that.</p>\n<p>On that wall rests the London Bills Backers\u2019 prized possession: a Union Jack flag featuring Josh Allen in a crown with the words \u201cGod Save the King\u201d written above him.</p>\n<p>With 1:10 left in the fourth quarter, the Bills season came down to one play. On fourth-and-1 from Jacksonville\u2019s 11-yard line, \u201cthe King\u201d lined up under center with fullback Reggie Gilliam behind him in the \u201cTush Push\u201d formation.</p>\n<p>The \u201cTush Push\u201d is usually expected to pick up, at most, two or three yards. But Gillam and the Bills\u2019 offensive line helped push Allen 10 yards, right up to the edge of the goal line.</p>\n<p>Another quarterback sneak on the next play gave Buffalo the lead. The pub broke out into a Josh Allen-themed song one would expect from a Premier League crowd; not an NFL one.</p>\n<p>Cole Bishop\u2019s interception on the first play of the Jaguars\u2019 final drive sealed the game. What ensued was pandemonium one can only expect from a fanbase like Bills Mafia.</p>\n<p>Amid the chaos, Buffalo native Rachel Eagan summated why her fanbase was the most passionate in England.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a part-time Bills fan,\u201d Eagan said.</p>\n",

            "rendered": "<p><strong>By Nolan Rogalski</strong></p>\n<p>LONDON \u2014 Since 1987, Arsenal Women Football Club had played home matches at the 4,500-seat Mangata Developments Stadium in Meadow Park, a quaint field an hour north of London used by fifth-division men\u2019s side Boreham Wood and the Arsenal academy.</p>\n<p>But that\u2019s changing after 38 years. From 2026 onward, the Gunners will play every home Women\u2019s Super League (WSL) match in Emirates Stadium, the modern, 60,000-seat behemoth in the heart of North London.</p>\n<p>The crowd of 37,726 fans for the Gunners\u2019 first home match of 2026, played against Manchester United on Jan. 11, symbolized the growth in popularity of women\u2019s soccer. The women\u2019s game is gaining momentum in the United Kingdom just as it is in the United States; moves to men\u2019s teams\u2019 stadiums help facilitate that growth, and Arsenal remains a step ahead of every other team.</p>\n<p>\u201cMeadow Park\u2019s nice, but nothing can beat here,\u201d said Amy Brand, one of the fans in the stands on Jan. 11. \u201cIt\u2019s just so powerful for us to be here, representing it in such a big stadium.\u201d</p>\n<p>Emirates Stadium is a powerful sight. The stadium, <a href=\"https://www.ice.org.uk/what-is-civil-engineering/infrastructure-projects/emirates-stadium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">which reportedly cost $350 million to build</a>, was completed in 2006. It is the sixth-largest soccer stadium by capacity in the United Kingdom. The imposing structure soars far above the surrounding neighborhoods, but fans of the women\u2019s team find the atmosphere at the Emirates welcoming.</p>\n<p>\u201cArsenal is just like a massive family,\u201d Gunners fan Steve Vaughan told CNS reporters ahead of the Gunners\u2019 0-0 draw against Manchester United. \u201cI feel, personally, a lot safer bringing my girls here than going to some of the old places.\u201d</p>\n<p>The family atmosphere is a goal the club hopes to achieve at an organizational level. Fans walk beneath a massive mural of Arsenal legends \u2014 featuring players from both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams \u2014 at the entrance of the stadium on the way to their gates.</p>\n<p>Such imagery linking the two sides is intentional. The club announced an increase in women\u2019s games at Emirates Stadium before the 2024-25 season as part of what Sporting Director Edu Gaspar called a \u201cvision to win major trophies across our men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams.\u201d</p>\n<p>That season ended with Arsenal lifting the UEFA Women\u2019s Champions League trophy for its second victory in the competition and first in nearly two decades. The men\u2019s team has never won the equivalent competition.</p>\n<p>The women\u2019s team has had sustained success since its founding \u2014 Arsenal have won 63 trophies over their 38-year history, including at least one trophy in 13 consecutive seasons from 2003 to 2016.</p>\n<p>As a result, the support for the women&#8217;s side has swelled over the years, leaving the club poised to make the leap to a larger stadium.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wslanalytics.com/p/inside-the-stands-wsl-attendance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">According to WSL Analytics</a>, the Gunners recorded an average attendance of 28,808 in the 2024-2025 season \u2014 more than three times the average attendance for the next-closest team.</p>\n<p><iframe id=\"datawrapper-chart-sWQSZ\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" title=\"2024-25 Women's Super League Average Attendances\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/sWQSZ/4/\" height=\"398\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" aria-label=\"Bar Chart\" data-external=\"1\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});</script></p>\n<p>Splitting time between stadiums is common across the WSL \u2014 several teams have staged meaningful games against rivals or high-level opponents in the men\u2019s stadiums. Historic grounds such as Stamford Bridge, Old Trafford and Anfield have played host to important games for the Chelsea, Manchester United and Liverpool women\u2019s teams, helping boost their average attendances.</p>\n<p>Beyond Arsenal, though, the league plays the majority of its games at smaller venues, limiting the potential for impressive crowds. That is largely due to necessity \u2014 most teams have not turned the same corner as Arsenal, and they remain far from packing the stadiums.</p>\n<p>But the more intimate environments provided by smaller grounds has been a big draw for some fans. Even Arsenal themselves aren\u2019t fully letting go of Meadow Park, which will be used for national cup games and the group stages of the Women\u2019s Champions League, in spite of the financial boon of ticket sales at Emirates Stadium.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do prefer Meadow Park because you\u2019re closer. It&#8217;s smaller, it\u2019s a tighter ground, it just feels better,\u201d Vaughan said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit more personal when it\u2019s a smaller stadium, but here [at the Emirates], they\u2019re definitely making more money out of the Arsenal fans.\u201d</p>\n<p>Money is important for a team such as Arsenal aiming to flex its power on the world stage. The club signed Olivia Smith in July from Liverpool for a then-world record $1.33 million. That transfer marked the second of four occasions in 2025 in which the transfer record would be broken, a sharp reminder of the rapid ascent of the women\u2019s game.</p>\n<p>At the same time, given half of WSL teams averaged under 4,000 fans per game last year, operating costs are a limiting factor. Not every women\u2019s team shares such a positive relationship with its counterpart on the men&#8217;s side, and not every club can pack major stadiums to a profitable degree.</p>\n<p>As the game continues to grow, however, so do the possibilities. Women\u2019s soccer is increasing in popularity, especially among younger fans, and Arsenal will be far from the last club to make that move.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe more clubs that do use the full stadium, I think can only be a good thing,\u201d said Andy Brice, a father of two young Arsenal fans who took his kids to a women\u2019s game for the first time to start 2026. \u201cIt just shows how the women\u2019s game is growing.\u201d</p>\n",

            "rendered": "<p><strong>By Jake Kauderer</strong></p>\n<p>LONDON \u2014 Football fans in the United Kingdom have mixed opinions on the World Cup coming to the United States.</p>\n<p>Some feel the political climate in the U.S. provides reason for hesitancy. But soccer fan Alfie Lisle said everyone he\u2019s spoken with shares a strong feeling around the tournament being in the U.S.</p>\n<p>Enthusiasm.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt&#8217;s exciting, isn&#8217;t it,\u201d Lisle said. \u201cI reckon [the U.S.] will put on a good show.\u201d</p>\n<p>This year marks the second time the U.S. will host the men\u2019s World Cup, and the first time since 1994. Lisle, a 32-year-old lifelong Chelsea fan, said he expects many from the UK to make the trip. He is staying with a friend in New Jersey and attending the final at MetLife Stadium \u2014 home of the National Football League&#8217;s New York Giants and New York Jets.</p>\n<p>The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and Capital News Service spoke to U.K. fans about the World Cup coming to the U.S.</p>\n<p>Lisle has been impressed by the spectacle that the U.S. creates with the Super Bowl every year. He expects that will translate to the World Cup, which takes place June 11 to July 19.</p>\n<p>The tournament will be shared by Canada, Mexico and the U.S. In 1994, Brazil beat Italy at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, in the first World Cup final decided on penalties.</p>\n<p>Excellent Abunum, a Manchester City fan since age 8, believes the event being stretched across 11 states, in cities from Los Angeles to Boston, is advantageous for U.K. fans who want to explore the U.S. But the 19-year-old doesn\u2019t think location is the driving factor for most fans.</p>\n<p>\u201c[If people] really like football, they wouldn&#8217;t care where it is,\u201d Abunum said. \u201cThey&#8217;d go because they like football.\u201d</p>\n<p>A record 48 teams are participating in this year\u2019s World Cup finals, with 78 of 104 matches in the U.S. Abunum said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if fans from places including Germany and Spain outnumber those from the U.K.</p>\n<p>Another U.K. fan, Eddie Harknett, pushed back on the tournament\u2019s international appeal.</p>\n<p>Harknett, 74, has been watching football since he was 7 years old. He said he knows many U.K. football fans and that many have decided not to attend the World Cup in the U.S. He cited the current political climate, including difficulties obtaining travel visas, as a key factor.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can&#8217;t see them making any money in America,\u201d Harknett said. \u201cCanada and Mexico [will make money].\u201d</p>\n<p>Eliot Evans, a player for Cardiff Met FC and a coach at Welsh University, also questioned the U.S. hosting considering its political climate. He also spoke about how international flight prices will dramatically increase around the tournament, which could turn some fans off.</p>\n<p>Still, Evans believes that attending the World Cup in the U.S. is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity..</p>\n<p>\u201cFrom a purely football perspective, getting eyes on America, hosting an event as big as the World Cup, where the whole world is watching, I think it can only be a positive thing if it&#8217;s done in the right way,\u201d Evans said.</p>\n",

            "rendered": "<p>LONDON \u2014 The fate of West Ham United, a Premier League club sitting near the bottom of the table and firmly in the relegation zone, changed in an instant thanks to two video assistant referee (VAR) reviews during a Jan. 6 match against Nottingham Forest.</p>\n<p>The pair of reviews doomed the Hammers in a 2-1 loss, much to the dismay of the 62,429 fans in attendance at London Stadium \u2014 and to some in the West Ham dressing room.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor me, it\u2019s a joke,\u201d West Ham midfielder Tom\u00e1\u0161 Sou\u010dek told Sky Sports about a check in the 89th minute that awarded Nottingham Forest the game-winning penalty kick. \u201cI came to the Premier League because I thought it was the toughest league in the world \u2026 but this looks like it\u2019s more like basketball because you can\u2019t touch the player anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>VAR, introduced in the Premier League during the 2019-20 season, is a technology that allows for extra reviews in \u201cmatch-changing situations\u201d (goals, penalties, direct red cards and mistaken identities), according to the league\u2019s website.</p>\n<p>There is a high bar for intervention on these calls \u2014 there must be a clear and obvious error or a serious missed incident from the referee to trigger a VAR check. From there, the referee will check the pitchside monitor to review the incident and make a final subjective decision.</p>\n<p>The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and Capital News Service observed the Premier League&#8217;s VAR hub, located at Stockley Park in west London, on Jan. 7.</p>\n<p>Inside the room, experts closely monitor every Premier League game with advanced technology that can measure controversial plays down to the millimeter.</p>\n<p>But VAR isn\u2019t meant to replace the on-field referees or to strip their decision-making power. Rather, the system is intended to serve as an extra set of eyes, offering additional context and information that can aid the referee in making their ultimate decision.</p>\n<p>Even while providing that boost, the system has sparked consistent debate among fans and clubs because of its tendency to shift a match\u2019s outcome.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_123732\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-123732\" style=\"width: 450px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"123732\" data-permalink=\"https://cnsmaryland.org/2026/01/10/controversial-finish-puts-premier-leagues-var-technology-in-spotlight/260106_amd_westhamunited0042-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://cnsmaryland.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/260106_amd_WestHamUnited0042-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1200,800\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"West Ham United London Stadium\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;(Austin DeSisto/Capital News Service)&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://cnsmaryland.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/260106_amd_WestHamUnited0042-1-300x300.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https://cnsmaryland.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/260106_amd_WestHamUnited0042-1-1024x683.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-123732\" src=\"https://cnsmaryland.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/260106_amd_WestHamUnited0042-1-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"West Ham United logo on seating at London Stadium\" width=\"450\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://cnsmaryland.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/260106_amd_WestHamUnited0042-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cnsmaryland.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/260106_amd_WestHamUnited0042-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cnsmaryland.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/260106_amd_WestHamUnited0042-1-770x513.jpg 770w, https://cnsmaryland.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/260106_amd_WestHamUnited0042-1-20x13.jpg 20w, https://cnsmaryland.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/260106_amd_WestHamUnited0042-1-385x257.jpg 385w, https://cnsmaryland.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/260106_amd_WestHamUnited0042-1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-123732\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Austin DeSisto/Capital News Service)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In the first controversial play in West Ham&#8217;s Jan. 6 match, the Hammers seemed to take a 2-0 lead when Crysencio Summerville fired in a shot off a deflection. But a VAR review led to the score being overturned because of an offside call in the play\u2019s build-up.</p>\n<p>Nottingham Forest equaled the score just moments later.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was the crucial moment of the game, a two-goal lead,\u201d West Ham coach Nuno Espirito Santo told reporters postgame. \u201cAll the stadium felt the pain of the goal ruled out.\u201d</p>\n<p>In the 89th minute, West Ham goalkeeper Alphonse Areola collided with Nottingham Forest\u2019s Morgan Gibbs-White while contesting a ball barreling toward the net. After a VAR check, referee Tony Harrington awarded the visitors the eventual game-winning penalty kick.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe didn&#8217;t know why there was VAR and then the penalty, so it was tough for all of us,\u201d Soucek said.</p>\n<p>League Managers Association chief executive Richard Beven said in November on the No Tippy Tappy Football podcast that VAR is \u201chere to stay.\u201d Excellent Abunum, a Manchester City fan who has followed the Premier League for years, believes VAR has its ups and downs but said it should remain in place.</p>\n<p>In the United States, the National Football League, Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association all have forms of official review. The most notable difference is that all three of those U.S.-based leagues allow for coaches&#8217; challenges, while the Premier League does not.</p>\n<p>\u201cVAR is a good thing because sometimes there are some decisions that, if there were no VAR, it would look stupid,\u201d Abunum told CNS. \u201cBut sometimes \u2026 they just take advantage.\u201d</p>\n",

            "rendered": "<p><strong>By Aidan Currie and Ben Geffner</strong></p>\n<p>LONDON \u2014 England\u2019s Premier League and the United States&#8217; Major League Soccer are comparable at the most fundamental levels. The rules of the sport are the same on both sides of the pond, teams play on similarly sized pitches, and each league is the highest level of club soccer in their respective countries.</p>\n<p>Off-field aspects, however \u2014 such as season formats, player salaries and fan customs \u2014 distinguish the EPL and MLS from one another. Compare and contrast the two leagues with The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and Capital News Service.</p>\n<h3>MLS vs. EPL: Histories</h3>\n<p>MLS featured 10 teams during its inaugural 1996 season. Thirty years later, that number has tripled.</p>\n<p>Soccer, in its modern form, was built in 19th-century England. First-division English football dates back to the 1880s, making it the oldest organized professional soccer league in the world.</p>\n<p>The Premier League, as it is now known, is just a few years older than MLS. It was created in 1992 to be a top division, effectively a rebranding of the First Division, but the new EPL retained historic teams and their storied pasts.</p>\n<p>Manchester United and Liverpool both have won the first division a record 20 times. Liverpool was the dominant club in the United Kingdom from the early 1970s to the late 1980s, then Manchester United overtook that mantle in the 1990s and 2000s.</p>\n<p>Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham are also considered iconic teams, alongside Manchester City, which has captured six of the past eight league titles.</p>\n<p>MLS clubs lack EPL\u2019s history and traditions but have developed a foundation of strong rivalries. D.C. United won three of the first four titles upon the league&#8217;s inception, but LA Galaxy has claimed a league-best six MLS Cups.</p>\n<h3>MLS vs. EPL: League formats</h3>\n<p>As with many American sports leagues, MLS is divided into geographic conferences \u2014 in this case Eastern and Western. That\u2019s not necessary in the EPL because England is similar in size to Alabama.</p>\n<p>The MLS regular season runs from late February to mid-October. The standings at the end of that season seed the 18-team playoff, which culminates in the MLS Cup final \u2014 a single-elimination match between the Western and Eastern Conference champions in early December.</p>\n<p>The league\u2019s calendar will shift in 2027, though, with MLS starting in July and ending in May \u2014 comparable to the schedule that most European leagues follow.</p>\n<p>England\u2019s 20-team Premier League starts in mid-August and stretches through late May, with the league trophy awarded to the team that accumulates the most points. The bottom three finishers get demoted to the second division.</p>\n<p>Promotion and relegation, a system in which top teams move to a higher division and finishers at the bottom move down, connect leagues across the nation in what\u2019s known as the English football pyramid. In the system, the top team in the top league \u2014 the Premier League \u2014 is considered the champion of the entire country.</p>\n<p>MLS has rejected promotion and relegation to this point, in part because uncertainty about where a team will play year to year can complicate team valuations and scare off investors. In March, however, the United Soccer League announced it was becoming the first pro sports league in the U.S. to move to promotion and relegation.</p>\n<p>MLS commissioner Don Garber, at his state-of-the-league address on December 4, <a href=\"https://frontofficesports.com/mls-garber-promotion-relegation/\">declined to rule out a move to promotion and relegation</a>, but such a change remains unlikely in the near future.</p>\n<h3>MLS vs. EPL: Financials</h3>\n<p>The original owners of MLS teams paid just $5 million. In 2023, owners of San Diego\u2019s expansion franchise bought into the league for $500 million. Three decades after MLS\u2019s first season, 19 of its 30 clubs are among the world\u2019s 50 most valuable soccer teams \u2014 more than any soccer league, according to Sportico, with the LA Galaxy said to be worth $1.25 billion, according to Forbes.</p>\n<p>International players have become a major feature of the league, with more countries represented last year in MLS (79) than EPL (62).</p>\n<p>The league&#8217;s biggest star, Argentina\u2019s Lionel Messi, joined Inter Miami in 2023 on a league-high $12 million base salary. An average MLS player salary is around $580,000, according to <a href=\"https://www.capology.com/us/mls/salaries/2025/\">Capology</a>. In contrast, the average player salary in the Premier League is more than $4 million, according to William Hill and ProSport.</p>\n<p>Premier League\u2019s lowest-paid player in 2024 earned more than $240,000, according to Sports Boom. That\u2019s more guaranteed compensation than nearly half (409) of MLS players listed on October\u2019s Players Association data records.</p>\n<p>Messi\u2019s 2023 arrival to MLS sparked rapid growth for the South Florida club and MLS overall. U.S. sign-up subscriptions to Apple TV\u2019s MLS Season Pass rose by 110,000 in one day that summer and the club gained more than 10 million social media followers in several months, according to Sports Business Journal and MLS Multiplex.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-XmOxV\" style=\"border: none;\" title=\"U.S. &amp;amp; U.K. Soccer Evaluation: 2024 vs 2025\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/XmOxV/1/\" width=\"600\" height=\"616\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" aria-label=\"Grouped column chart\" data-external=\"1\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Despite that growth, MLS hasn\u2019t approached the worldwide popularity of its British counterpart. In 2025, Premier League\u2019s revenue exceeded $7 billion compared to $1.85 billion for MLS, according to Profluence founder Andrew Petcash.</p>\n<p>The Premier League remains the highest-grossing soccer league and fourth-highest professional sports league worldwide, behind the National Football League, National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball.</p>\n<h3>MLS vs. EPL: Fan and stadium culture</h3>\n<p>Individual tickets for EPL matches can be costly.</p>\n<p>Ticket broker SeatPick notes that the average ticket to a Liverpool match on its site is $1,137. EPL season tickets tend to carry more moderate price tags than fans can find on the secondary market. West Ham boasts the cheapest Premier League season ticket in 2025-26, at just \u00a3345 \u2014 equivalent to $463.89 for 38 games.</p>\n<p>MLS fans benefit from even bigger bargains. According to the website SportsHandle, a ticket to an Austin FC at Vancouver Whitecaps match in 2024 could be bought for just $4.50.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-4JjjA\" style=\"border: none;\" title=\"Average Attendance Over Time: Premier League vs MLS\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/4JjjA/1/\" width=\"594\" height=\"606\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" aria-label=\"Grouped column chart\" data-external=\"1\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Hot dog prices at EPL and MLS venues are relatively similar. MLS\u2019 Inter Miami charged a league-most $42.68 for four hot dogs in 2024, according to Scarves and Spikes. That\u2019s over $10 per hot dog \u2014 compared to $12.75 for a &#8220;Cobble Lane&#8221; hot dog at Arsenal\u2019s Emirates Stadium and Manchester United\u2019s $7.76 hot dog.</p>\n<p>Fourteen EPL clubs raised their beer prices this offseason \u2014 headlined by a 51% increase from Manchester United, according to The Mirror.</p>\n<p>Two slices of pizza at the New England Revolution\u2019s Gillette Stadium cost $39.98 in April 2025. Seattle\u2019s Lumen Field charges $17.99 for a smoked chicken sandwich on King\u2019s Hawaiian sweet rolls and a whopping $48.99 for a pork rib slider platter, according to the Seattle Times.</p>\n",

            "rendered": "<p>In the wake of the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on immigration, many Maryland residents are trying to understand how federal programs intersect with local policing and what these practices mean for them.</p>\n<p>To shed light on these questions, reporters Aline Behar Kado and Haley Parsley, who cover immigration for Capital News Service, joined a Reddit Ask Me Anything (AMA) with Ghaiesha Legrand to walk the public through what they have uncovered in their investigation of the 287(g) program. This program allows local police to work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>\n<p><strong><em>AMA Question: Thanks for the reporting. Is there any bar of evidence that local law enforcement needs to meet for &#8220;suspicion that detainees are in the country illegally?&#8221; Do detainees get a chance to counter this suspicion?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Sheriffs who run the jail enforcement model say their staff asks every newly arrested person about their immigration status when they are first booked. If the correctional officers believe someone was not born in the U.S., they search the person in an ICE database, which they\u2019re granted access to as part of their participation in the 287(g) program.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">The public, including journalists, does not have access to that database. We are told it contains records that help determine an individual\u2019s immigration status.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">After local law enforcement agencies tell ICE that they have an undocumented person in their custody, it\u2019s up to ICE to decide if they want the agency to hold that person. If they do, ICE has 48 hours to take that person into custody. The person in custody is not able to counter or appeal any of these decisions.</p>\n<p><strong><em>AMA Question: Also, do you know what people who are transferred over to ICE are generally being held for initially?</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most serious conviction among people transferred to ICE under Maryland\u2019s 287(g) program is driving under the influence (30%), according to our analysis of records from the </span><a href=\"https://deportationdata.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deportation Data Project</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Traffic offenses, assault and larceny are the other top-most serious convictions for these arrests, accounting for 22%, 10%, and 7%, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><b><i>AMA Question: Why is ICE permitted to anonymously seize people without warrants or respect for their person?</i></b></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ICE does not need to present a warrant to arrest someone in a public space. However, they do need warrants to arrest anyone in their homes or other private spaces. Being a federal agency, ICE does not necessarily operate under the same rules as a local agency.</span></p>\n<p><em><b>AMA Q</b><b>uestion: Can anyone they don&#8217;t like be &#8220;suspicious&#8221; and is there any oversight?</b></em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Some participating sheriffs in Maryland run the jail enforcement model. They tell us they ask all newly arrested individuals about their immigration status when they are first booked. If the correctional officers believe someone was not born in the U.S., they search the person in an ICE database, which they\u2019re granted access to as part of their participation in the 287(g) program. If they find that a person is undocumented, they alert ICE, who may then issue a detainer for the sheriff to hold the individual for up to 48 hours.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Because every person who\u2019s booked is also screened, participating sheriffs argue that the program is not discriminatory. Advocacy groups like the ACLU argue that the program does facilitate discrimination.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">ICE provides training and conducts inspections to make sure each local office is compliant with the rules of the program.</p>\n<p><b><i>AMA Question: Is it possible to provide stats of how many of the illegal immigrants arrested by ICE had detainers for violent crimes?</i></b></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it is hard to define what constitutes violent crimes, we can expand on what the most serious convictions many of the individuals arrested under this program were charged with.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Driving under the influence of liquor (30%)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traffic offense (22%)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assault (10%)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Larceny (7%)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Domestic violence (3%)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Burglary (2%)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cocaine &#8211; possession (2%)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Illegal entry (2%)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resisting officer (2%)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simple assault (2%)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are more charges that go below 1 percent of arrests under this program in Maryland.</span></p>\n<p><b><i>AMA Question: Are total arrests much lower in places that don&#8217;t participate in the 287(g) program? How many counties or cities explicitly have laws that say they won&#8217;t participate in that, or that they won&#8217;t cooperate with ICE? I remember this being something people were trying to put in place in Anne Arundel County back in like 2018, but I&#8217;m not sure how successful it was across the state.</i></b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(1) The ICE data that the public and journalists have access to doesn\u2019t provide county- or city-level data on the location of most street arrests. The 287(g) arrests are typically\u00a0 associated with a county\u2019s specific program, and that\u2019s why we know where those arrests took place.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(2) No counties in Maryland have banned the 287(g) program, but in 2018, Anne Arundel backtracked on a plan to participate.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(3) Last session, the Maryland House passed a bill to ban the program, but it didn\u2019t get through the Senate. Del. Nicole Williams has said she will reintroduce the ban this coming session\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><b><i>AMA Question: Why do you think Frederick leads among counties? I would have assumed one of the DC-adjacent counties.</i></b></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only eight counties in Maryland have agreed to work with ICE, and Frederick leads among those counties. In part, that\u2019s because Frederick\u2019s program is well-established\u2014 it has existed since 2008.</span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s evidence that ICE is making street arrests across Maryland, but those arrests are not associated with the 287(g) program.</span></p>\n<p><b><i>AMA Question: How many people has ICE disappeared?</i></b></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">The sheriffs have transferred 119 people to ICE under this program in Maryland from January 20, 2025, to the end of our data analysis (July 29, 2025). According to ICE, family members or others close to the individual arrested can use their A-number (or Alien Registration number) to track the person, even if they move between detention centers across the country.</p>\n<p><b><i>AMA Question: How many stops are made without warrants? We\u2019ve seen that they claim to use \u201creasonable suspicion,\u201d but unfortunately that seems to be just based on skin color and racial stereotypes (food locations, work types, vehicle types). Thus making it hard to put a statistic to actually show how many people are legally/illegally being detained.</i></b></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 287(g) programs in which Maryland sheriffs participate are jail-based, so Maryland sheriffs are not deputized to make arrests based on immigration status.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Legally, ICE does not need to present a warrant for stops or arrests made in public spaces.</span></p>\n<p><b><i>AMA Question: In addition to this, I\u2019m curious about job statistics in each county in which arrests are being made.</i></b></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">ICE arrests are being made across the state. However, only eight sheriffs in Maryland participate in the 287(g) program. Arrests made through this program do not take an individual\u2019s employment into account.</p>\n",

Those agents,</span><a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/immigrants-rights/border-patrol-agents-replace-top-leadership-at-ice-offices-despite-human-rights-violations\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the ACLU </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">says, are more aggressive, and have a track record of human rights violations at the nation\u2019s border.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maryland sheriffs have become some of ICE\u2019s most prolific partners. The percentage of ICE arrests in the state that originate within the 287(g) program are higher than most other areas in the country, as CNS </span><a href=\"https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/11/13/marylands-surprising-role-in-implementing-trumps-immigration-agenda/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">previously reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Frederick County Sheriff\u2019s Office remains ICE\u2019s most active partner under the 287(g) program in Maryland. Of the 170 total custody transfers recorded across the state\u2019s participating detention centers since Trump was inaugurated, more than half\u201492\u2014originated at the Frederick County Adult Detention Center.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But that doesn\u2019t mean street arrests don\u2019t happen in the state. The analysis, which used data obtained from the Deportation Data Project, found that even though eight counties in Maryland collaborate with ICE, the agency still regularly arrests immigrants on the street.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since Trump took office back in January, over 2,000 people have been arrested by ICE agents in Maryland communities. Over 70% of those immigrants, the analysis found, had no prior criminal convictions. Only 170 people were taken into ICE custody through partnership programs in the state. More than half of those people had prior criminal convictions.</span></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_123640\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-123640\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"123640\" data-permalink=\"https://cnsmaryland.org/1b9a3666-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://cnsmaryland.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1B9A3666-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2560,1707\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"1B9A3666\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;A 287(g)-certified officer monitors the booking desk at the Frederick County Adult Detention Center in Frederick, Md., Thursday, Dec. 11, 2025.

Nicole Williams, a Democrat who represents part of Prince George\u2019s County, </span><a href=\"https://marylandmatters.org/2025/11/14/billl-to-ban-local-police-cooperation-with-ice-to-return-with-important-new-support/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has pledged</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to re-introduce legislation from last session that would do just that.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Williams said she isn\u2019t convinced by Jenkins\u2019 arguments. The Department of Homeland Security has launched high-profile immigration enforcement campaigns in states where law enforcement enthusiastically participates in the 287(g) program, like Louisiana, she said.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said the 287(g) program harms immigrants and could cause crimes to go unreported.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThey don&#8217;t know if they can trust their local police to not, in turn, contact ICE,\u201d Williams told CNS. \u201cIf a crime is committed in their neighborhood, they want to be able to report that crime. If they&#8217;re a victim of crime, they want to be able to feel comfortable going to the police.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yanet Amanuel, public policy director at the ACLU of Maryand, agreed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cConsenting in advance to President Trump\u2019s authoritarian agenda will not keep our communities safe,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThis administration&#8217;s priorities are not Maryland&#8217;s priorities and do not reflect our values of treating everyone who calls Maryland home with dignity and respect.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though last year\u2019s ban didn\u2019t pass, Amanuel said, Maryland has still been targeted by the Trump administration. The state \u201cstill suffered devastating federal spending cuts and mass deportations,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the face of more federal threats, Maryland must bravely choose courage and refuse to aid and abet the federal campaign of terror against immigrants.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maryland does not </span><a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/ag/us-sanctuary-jurisdiction-list-following-executive-order-14287-protecting-american-communities#:~:text=States:,San%20Francisco%20City%2C%20CA\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">currently appear</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on the Department of Justice\u2019s list of \u201csanctuary jurisdictions,\u201d which is updated periodically.

Under the president\u2019s first administration, during </span><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/video/5804309415001\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a 2018 appearance</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Fox News, Jenkins criticized the idea that ICE agents were heavy-handed, or used inhumane tactics. Under Trump, he said, \u201cthe gloves are off, they can now do their jobs.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with CNS, he again dismissed the criticism that the Trump administration has misstepped by detaining immigrants with no criminal record, and described the events as \u201ccollateral arrests.\u201d But he said that the 287(g) program presented an \u201corderly\u201d alternative to the chaotic street raids Marylanders have watched play out across the country, and in the state, over the past few months.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jenkins argues that the program does not cause the immigrant community to mistrust law enforcement. \u201cMost of the countries where these people are coming from, there&#8217;s already a distrust of police,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause those countries are corrupt.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">State Sen. Michael McKay, who represents Allegany, Garrett and Washington counties, met with Jenkins earlier this fall to learn more about the 287(g) program. He bought the sheriff\u2019s argument.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf we outlaw the 287(g) program,\u201d he told CNS, \u201cwe are welcoming the federal government to come in with blanket immigration removal.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program protects people, McKay said, who have not committed crimes from being thrown into a broad net of ICE arrests \u201cinadvertently.\u201d\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI tend to believe if we&#8217;re going to be looking at people who shouldn&#8217;t be here, who have </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">heinous crimes, that their exit strategy should be when they&#8217;re already in our detention centers. Because if we&#8217;re not working with our detention centers, then we&#8217;re going to be casting out to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the public as a whole,\u201d McKay told CNS. \u201cAnd I think we might make errors there.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even with McKay\u2019s support, Jenkins says he\u2019s not optimistic about the fate of the 287(g) program in Maryland. \u201cThis to me is like the Alamo,\u201d he told CNS.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But he\u2019s already preparing his next strategy. \u201cif there&#8217;s legislation that passes,\u201d he said, \u201c I believe there&#8217;s a constitutional challenge for that.\u201d\u00a0</span></p>\n",
