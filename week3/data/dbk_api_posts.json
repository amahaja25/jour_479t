      "rendered": "<p>Maryland\u2019s budget underwent significant cuts this year as state legislators grappled with a deficit going into fiscal year 2026.</p>\n<p>As the year ended and lawmakers prepare for the 2026 Maryland General Assembly legislative session, here are three key takeaways about major changes the state\u2019s budget went through \u2014 and how they affect the University of Maryland.</p>\n<p><strong>Maryland\u2019s budget deficit increased dramatically, driving statewide cuts</strong></p>\n<p>Maryland faces a nearly $1.5 billion budget deficit in fiscal year 2027, according to a November briefing to state officials.</p>\n<p>This estimated deficit is about a $1.2 billion \u2014 or 400 percent \u2014 jump from the state\u2019s earlier estimate of $300 million in March, the Maryland Department of Legislative Services\u2019 report stated.</p>\n<p>The state&#8217;s structural deficit, where it commits to spending more money than it brings in through revenue, was $753 million in fiscal year 2025. This deficit is projected to be $259 million in fiscal 2026 and roughly $1.2 billion in fiscal 2027, according to the report.</p>\n<p><iframe class=\"flourish-embed-iframe\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 600px;\" title=\"Interactive or visual content\" src=\"https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/26727572/embed\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\"></iframe><br />\nA major factor that contributed to this shift is the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a federal law signed by President Donald Trump in July that significantly reduced Maryland\u2019s revenue by about $371 million, according to the briefing. Additional factors that widened the deficit include K-12 education funding and Medicaid behavioral health costs.</p>\n<p>With less money available, the state has been unable to sustain previous funding levels across key sectors, including higher education. As a result, this university and other University System of Maryland institutions now operate in a far more restrictive fiscal environment shaped directly by the state\u2019s widening budget gap.</p>\n<p><strong>USM absorbs a $163.4 million cut, triggering tuition increases and program constraints</strong></p>\n<p>State funding for USM decreased by about $163 million, or 6.9 percent, as part of the Maryland General Assembly\u2019s final budget plan for fiscal year 2026.</p>\n<p>This university told colleges and departments to reduce spending as administrators worked to understand the financial impacts of Maryland\u2019s budget cuts with USM, according to a campuswide email from university president Darryll Pines in April.</p>\n<p>University administrators wrote in a June email that the university will receive $59 million less in funding for fiscal year 2026 compared to the year before.</p>\n<p><iframe class=\"flourish-embed-iframe\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 600px;\" title=\"Interactive or visual content\" src=\"https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/26732917/embed\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\"></iframe><br />\nAs a result of the cuts to USM, tuition and mandatory fees at this university rose for fiscal year 2026.</p>\n<p>In-state tuition and out-of-state tuition for undergraduate and graduate students increased by 4 percent and 2 percent, respectively. Mandatory university fees increased by 4.5 percent for undergraduates, and 5 percent for graduate students.</p>\n<p><strong>USM authorized furloughs, salary reductions</strong></p>\n<p>The University System of Maryland Board of Regents in May authorized its member schools the authority to furlough employees and temporarily reduce salaries in response to budget pressures.</p>\n<p>The Board of Regents\u2019 approval does not require universities to use those measures, but it adds them to the system\u2019s list of cost-saving options alongside hiring slowdowns and reductions in operating expenses. Each USM institution is responsible for creating its own annual budget plan, and can choose to implement cost-saving measures, which include personnel-related actions.</p>\n<p>So far, this university has not executed furloughs or salary cuts.</p>\n<p>But before the Board of Regents passed its resolution, the university instituted a partial hiring freeze and tightened hiring review guidelines, according to an email sent to faculty and staff in March.</p>\n<p>Temporary salary reductions or decisions to furlough employees would be subject to review by the university system chancellor, and would be administered while consulting \u201cappropriate employee resolutions,\u201d according to the resolution.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nearing the midway point of Friday\u2019s third period, 197-pounder Alex Smith tried to flip Maryland wrestling\u2019s Branson John on his back.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, John spun out of Smith\u2019s arms and flipped behind Smith before pinning him to the mat.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Normally, the reversal and pin combo would have been a significant momentum shift for Maryland with one bout remaining. But John\u2019s pin proved inconsequential to the final outcome \u2014 the Terps dropped their conference opener, 27-12, to Northwestern at Welsh-Ryan Arena on Friday.</span></p>\n<p><b>Slow start plagues Terps</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Terps (4-2, 0-1 Big Ten) had started from behind in all but one of their duals this season. Friday\u2019s contest against Northwestern (3-1, 1-0 Big Ten) was no different. Maryland dropped four of their first five bouts.</span></p>\n<p><em><strong>[<a href=\"https://dbknews.com/2026/01/04/maryland-wrestling-score-recap-result-southern-scuffle/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Braxton Brown\u2019s second-place finish headlines Maryland wrestling\u2019s strong showing at Southern Scuffle</a>]</strong></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No. 12 Braxton Brown had been an energy killer for Maryland\u2019s opposition in prior bouts. But Friday, the redshirt senior dropped his first dual bout since Nov. 15.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pace favored Brown throughout most of the bout, as the first two periods featured minimal shots and a plethora of hand fighting. In prior bouts with slow pacing, Brown had frequently found an opportunistic moment to take a shot and secure a takedown in the third period.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But against No. 23 133-pounder Sean Spidle, the opposite happened.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With 44 seconds remaining, Spidle used an underhook to break the handfighting of Brown and pivot around Brown\u2019s waist into a double-leg takedown. The three-point score put Brown in a 4-2 deficit, and Spidle prevented Brown from gaining an opportunity to take a shot by keeping Brown on the mat for the remainder of the bout.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Terps then dropped two of their next three bouts, putting them in a costly 14-3 disadvantage heading into halftime.</span></p>\n<p><b>Carter Young continues to impress at 149 pounds</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the few bright spots for the Terps was newcomer Carter Young. The No. 14 149-pounder debuted for the Terps during the two-day Southern Scuffle tournament on Jan. 3-4.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The midseason transfer from Oklahoma State stood out during the tournament with his win against then-No. 1 Cross Wasilewski. His margins of victory were impressive \u2014 Young earned bonus points in three of his four bouts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While he forfeited all of his Sunday bouts due to a match count set by head coach Alex Clemsen</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the redshirt senior continued to impress Friday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Young\u2019s bout started similarly to his first three tournament contests, claiming an early 5-0 lead on a takedown and a pair of backpoints shortly after. His first-period dominance forced Northwestern\u2019s Sam Cartella to opt for neutral position to begin the second period \u2014\u00a0rather than starting in the down position.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision was beneficial. Young never scored again in the bout.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Maryland\u2019s newcomer also elected to change style in the third period. He spent most of that time on the mat, chewing clock despite a pair of stalling warnings.</span></p>\n<p><em><strong>[<a href=\"https://dbknews.com/2025/12/13/maryland-wrestling-score-recap-result-pitt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Maryland wrestling dismantled by No. 16 Pitt in home opener, 35-3</a>]</strong></em></p>\n<p><b>No. 5 Jaxon Smith remains out during Big Ten play</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With No. 5 Jaxon Smith returning from his All-American season, the 184-pound weight class seemed like an advantage for the Terps in nearly every bout heading into the season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But an injury to Smith in mid-November has done the opposite. The Terps had used Seth Digby as a replacement for Smith in duals, but the freshman had struggled in limited action.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those struggles continued Friday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Digby struggled to get off the mat against J.D. Perez. He picked up three stall warnings before the second period\u2019s conclusion, issuing Perez a pair of points and 8-0 lead heading into the final period.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, he failed to score in the final period and allowed Northwestern to secure bonus points. The Wildcats earned bonus points in four bouts Friday.</span></p>\n",

The No. 8 Terps knocked down a season-high 16 threes, their most in a Big Ten game since 2022, in a dominant 88-41 win over Rutgers Thursday.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have no idea [how it happened], but it&#8217;s always fun to go out there and to see the ball go through the net,\u201d Garzon said.</p>\n<p>Thursday solidified coach Brenda Frese\u2019s lineup.</p>\n<p><em><strong>[<a href=\"https://dbknews.com/2026/01/05/maryland-womens-basketball-result-score-recap-indiana/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Oluchi Okananwa paces No. 7 Maryland women\u2019s basketball in 82-67 win over Indiana</a>]</strong></em></p>\n<p>With a slew of injuries to begin the season, Maryland (16-1, 4-1 Big Ten) struggled to find a consistent starting five. But now, Addi Mack, Saylor Poffenbarger, Oluchi Okananwa, Isimenme Ozzy-Momodu and Yarden Garzon have secured it.</p>\n<p>Every starter except for Poffenbarger scored in double figures Thursday \u2014 part of a more consistent and balanced offensive attack. Stout defense from the group forced the Scarlet Knights (8-8, 0-5 Big Ten) to just 16 first-half points on 4-for-26 shooting.</p>\n<p>Rutgers\u2019 eventual 41-point total was Maryland\u2019s third-fewest allowed in a conference game since 2014.</p>\n<p>The Terps, fueled by Garzon, made each of their first five 3-pointers \u2014 contributing to a quick 22 first-quarter points. Maryland shot above 60 percent from beyond the arc in the first half.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought we set the tone really aggressively with our defense as well as our unselfishness on offense,\u201d Frese said.</p>\n<p>Despite sporadic playing time this season, freshman Rainey Welson delivered Thursday. With her minutes restriction lifted, Welson logged a career-high 12 points in a sixth-man role off the bench.</p>\n<p><em><strong>[<a href=\"https://dbknews.com/2026/01/01/maryland-womens-basketball-score-recap-result-illinois-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Turnovers doom Maryland women\u2019s basketball in first loss, 73-70 to Illinois</a>]</strong></em></p>\n<p>\u201cOur December was difficult,\u201d Frese said. \u201cWe had to be able to rest Rainey \u2026 now it&#8217;s nice to be able to see us rounded into form, just being able to be healthy and being able to get everyone back.\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Okananwa has been a constant force for the Terps this year. After setting a new career high against Indiana Sunday, she entered Thursday just 19 away from 1,000 career points. A 9-point performance put her 10 points closer to the goal.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Maryland\u2019s cohesive defense limited Rutgers to inconsistent offense and few second-chance looks. Ozzy-Momodu led the Terps with 12 rebounds, part of an evolving frontcourt presence alongside freshman Mayra Boiko.</p>\n<p>Boiko and Kyndal Walker have been among the firsts off Frese\u2019s bench since conference play began. Boiko adds crucial height to the post position, while Walker&#8217;s quick cuts and perimeter ball movement add a needed energy spark.</p>\n<p>The two have eased Maryland&#8217;s depth issues and combined for a plus-minus of 53 Thursday.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love being able to see that growth that we&#8217;ve been able to have from the bench, because they&#8217;ve really gained a lot of confidence \u2014\u00a0we need every single one of them,\u201d Freses said. \u201cIt makes us that much stronger as a team, and you can weather some foul trouble, and every single player on this roster can play.\u201d</p>\n",

Indiana, like many of the Terps&#8217; previous opponents, fell to her dominance Sunday in Maryland\u2019s 82-67 win at Xfinity Center.</p>\n<p>Okananwa scored a career-high 34 points six days after setting a career-best mark of 28. The junior guard, who averages 16.1 points, 5.1 rebounds and 2.1 assists, posted the most points by a Maryland player this season on 12 of 22 shooting.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust the moment I got down here, especially with my offensive game \u2026 I was given a lot more freedom than I have had in my college career,\u201d Okananwa said. \u201cI think coach and the coaching staff, they&#8217;ve just done an amazing job of nurturing that, and just watch me kind of blossom into this new, more offensive, aggressive player.\u201d</p>\n<p>Maryland was coming off its first loss of the season, a 73-70 defeat to Illinois in Champaign. The Illini gave the Terps their first moment of adversity after they had flown through the opening two months undefeated.</p>\n<p><em><strong>[<a href=\"https://dbknews.com/2025/12/29/maryland-womens-basketball-score-recap-result-wisconsin-3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Oluchi Okananwa scores career-high as Maryland women\u2019s basketball destroys Wisconsin, 97-59</a>]</strong></em></p>\n<p>\u201cI feel like in the Illinois game we weren&#8217;t really there, but we had a team talk, and we had to regather ourselves,\u201d Isimenme Ozzy-Momodu said.</p>\n<p>In addition to Okananwa\u2019s performance, the Terps had a piece of Indiana on their side.</p>\n<p>Yarden Garzon, a former Hoosier, played three seasons under head coach Teri Moren before transferring to Maryland. Garzon faced five players she had previously played with on Sunday.</p>\n<p>Garzon led Indiana in scoring in the 2024-2025 season and left Bloomington with 220 three-pointers, a program all-time high. She has carried that dominance to College Park, leading the Terps in triples through more than two months. She sank two threes Sunday, making up most of her eight total points.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is kind of special to play against the team that you were playing for for three years, but once the ball is out there, it&#8217;s a game no matter who is playing against you,\u201d Garzon said. \u201cSo just trying to focus and do what I need to for my team.\u201d</p>\n<p>Okananwa, tasked with guarding Indiana leading scorer Shay Ciezki, held the senior guard to 17 points, six below her season average.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought we really tuned in a lot more on the defensive end. We made life difficult. Shay only got nine shots up compared to what she&#8217;s been having to do,\u201d Frese said. \u201cI thought defensively, we were really locked in tonight and played the right way.\u201d</p>\n<p><em><strong>[<a href=\"https://dbknews.com/2025/12/19/maryland-womens-basketball-bri-mcdaniel-out-for-season/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bri McDaniel to redshirt Maryland women\u2019s basketball\u2019s season amid ACL recovery</a>]</strong></em></p>\n<p>Okananwa is a prime example of Maryland&#8217;s steal and score mentality. Her three steals on Sunday contributed to her career-high performance, moving the ball coast to coast on multiple occasions.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t just her, though. The Terps forced 21 Indiana turnovers in the first half, adding to their 324-season total of forced turnovers. Their offense capitalized on their defensive prowess, with 25 points off the giveaways.</p>\n<p>After leading by seven points at halftime, Maryland outscored the Hoosiers by eight after the break.</p>\n<p>The win came alongside Maryland celebrating the 20th anniversary of its 2006 National Championship team, with past Terp champions in attendance at Xfinity Center.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it&#8217;s pretty cool to be in this atmosphere and to be able to interact with those same ladies, because they&#8217;re chasing a goal that every single one of us is chasing as well,\u201d Okananwa said. \u201cTo be able to honor that kind of gives us an extra fuel and extra boost of reminding us who we&#8217;re playing for.\u201d</p>\n",

At the Southern Scuffle, John\u2019s first bout followed a similar pattern, but his next two showcased his strong defense.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John, rather than taking a volume-shot approach, used a strong base to beat opponents through keeping them off his lower body. He limited them to just three combined points. The 3-0 start advanced John to Sunday\u2019s round of bouts, where he fell in the final period against No. 1 Josh Barr.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><em><strong>[<a href=\"https://dbknews.com/2025/12/12/maryland-wrestling-weight-class-struggles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u2018Be a dog\u2019: Alex Clemsen seeks more from 3 Maryland wrestling weight classes</a>]</strong></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After his bout against Pitt\u2019s No. 11 Mac Stout</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Dec. 13, coach Alex Clemsen said John needed to compete for a full seven minutes against top opponents.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> While he lost to Barr, he rebounded and won his next two bouts to secure a third-place finish.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><b>Carter Young impresses in Terps\u2019 debut</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clemsen announced that Maryland was bringing in Carter Young as a midseason transfer on Dec. 3</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The redshirt senior spent his prior seasons at Oklahoma State, sporting a 10-10 record last season at 149 pounds. Young made an instant impact as a Terp.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He scored at least 17 points in each of his first three bouts and ended two of them within the first five minutes as a result of technical falls. Young accrued most of his points early in games, notching 12 of his 15 takedowns in the opening period. The early takedowns allowed him to flip opponents on their backs and tally nearfall points, resulting in seven-point swings in Young\u2019s favor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Young\u2019s best performance came in the quarterfinals match against Penn\u2019s Cross Wasilewski, who entered the tournament as the top seed and InterMat\u2019s No. 4 149-pounder in the nation</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Young, similarly to his prior three bouts, notched two takedowns in the first minute and took a 6-2 lead into the third period. After seeing his lead cut in half, he escaped 13 seconds into the third for a needed insurance point.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, he displayed stout defense.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Oklahoma native spent most of the third period near the edges of the circle, frustrating Wasilewski as the two frequently ended out of bounds. Young\u2019s strategy did eventually give Wasilewski a stalling point, but his tactic was enough to secure a 7-5 victory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The win advanced Young to Sunday, but he forfeited all of his remaining bouts, resulting in a sixth-place finish.</span></p>\n<p><b>Heavyweight 125 and 157-pound classes continue to struggle</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following Maryland\u2019s prior two duals, Clemsen stated he wanted to see more from his heavyweight, 125 and 157-pound classes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He specifically said he wanted them to assert themselves in matches.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> But after a nearly three-week break, those struggles continued.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slow starts were a common reason for each group\u2019s struggles, and Saturday\u2019s round of bouts was no different. The Terps saw four wrestlers competing across the three classes. They combined for four points in their opening bouts.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While heavyweight Oscar Williams improved in the consolation bracket, Maryland\u2019s 125 and 157-pounders continued to have difficulty scoring. The groups boasted just nine points across four consolation games, with the bulk of their opponents\u2019 scoring coming in the final period.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neither group advanced to Sunday\u2019s bouts and finished the tournament with a combined 3-8 record \u2014 a troubling sign for a Terps team that begins Big Ten play on Friday.</span></p>\n",

The Terps\u2019 two wins in the final month of the calendar year came against \u201cbuy-game\u201d opponents in Wagner and Old Dominion.</p>\n<p>Still, Buzz Williams was hopeful. He stressed that his team had positive carryover despite lackluster results.</p>\n<p>That feeling hasn\u2019t translated to opponents that matter. Friday marked another glaring example.</p>\n<p>Despite hanging around for much of the second half, Maryland couldn\u2019t overcome a putrid offensive performance in a 64-54 loss to Oregon at Xfinity Center. The Terps shot 18-for-65 (27.7 percent) from the field, missed 28 3-pointers and logged one make in the game\u2019s final three-and-a-half-minutes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought we shot a lot of green-light shots \u2014 we just didn\u2019t make them,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t shoot the percentage that you need to shoot to win a Big Ten game.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Terps (7-7, 0-3 Big Ten), who entered Friday with the Big Ten\u2019s worst turnover rate, committed double-digit takeaways for the fourth time in five games \u2014 seven of their 10 came in the second half.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Solomon Washington poured in a season-high 17 points and 12 rebounds, a needed performance amid Maryland\u2019s inefficient offensive play. He joined junior guard Isaiah Watts (11 points) as the only players to reach double figures.</p>\n<p><strong><em>[<a href=\"https://dbknews.com/2025/12/28/maryland-mens-basketball-score-recap-result-old-dominion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Maryland men\u2019s basketball\u2019s new-look starting lineup beats Old Dominion, 73-58</a>]</em></strong></p>\n<p>The pair, part of Maryland\u2019s seventh starting lineup this season alongside Darius Adams, Andre Mills and Elijah Saunders, impressed in its first minutes together Sunday against Old Dominion, so much so that Williams kept it intact Friday.</p>\n<p>The group sported a plus-minus of 19 in the Terps\u2019 15-point win over the Monarchs, the best rate by a Maryland lineup without senior forward Pharrel Payne this season. Payne, the Terps\u2019 leading scorer and rebounder, missed his third straight game due to injury Friday \u2014 part of five Maryland inactives.</p>\n<p>Williams adjusted to his 6-foot-9 forward\u2019s absence Sunday through a revamped \u201c5-out\u201d offense that found perimeter success. Maryland\u2019s guard trio of Watts, Mills and Adams combined for 39 first-half points.</p>\n<p>That number withered to nine against a quicker, taller and more athletic Oregon (7-7, 1-2 Big Ten) defense.</p>\n<p>Watts and Adams shot a combined 3-for-8 in the first frame, while Mills was held scoreless on 0-for-5 shooting \u2014 a number that eventually ballooned to 1-for-10.</p>\n<p>Maryland\u2019s starting group claimed an early lead over the Ducks before the first media timeout. The Terps held it for 56 seconds.</p>\n<p>They closed the half shooting 27.3 percent from the field, a rate that held steady in the second.</p>\n<p>Late 2-3 zone looks from the Ducks forced a flurry of offensive adjustments by Williams \u2014 almost none of which were effective for long periods.</p>\n<p><em><strong>[<a href=\"https://dbknews.com/2026/01/01/maryland-womens-basketball-score-recap-result-illinois-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Turnovers doom Maryland women\u2019s basketball in first loss, 73-70 to Illinois</a>]</strong></em></p>\n<p>The Terps searched for scores in \u201c4-out\u201d and \u201c3-out\u201d sets, often with Washington hunting the high and low posts for paint looks. But Oregon filled the gaps, limiting second-chance looks while jetting to a 9-0 road run midway through the first half that Maryland couldn\u2019t recover from.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re shooting more long shots, it\u2019s hard to get long rebounds,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of a delicate balance.\u201d</p>\n<p>Williams, in an effort to match physicality without Payne, shuffled a carousel of defenders on Bittle. Collin Metcalf, Washington and Saunders rotated against Oregon\u2019s 7-foot center.</p>\n<p>Bittle played right around his season averages with 16 points and seven rebounds, but he gobbled up five blocks against a shorthanded Terps frontcourt. Maryland\u2019s man defense struggled without true backline help, allowing 32 paint points despite outrebounding the Ducks on the offensive glass, 16-7.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to change the margins in which we\u2019re competing in, and then trying to have measurements not just on gameday, but in practice where our guys see improvement,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI understand the results and how we\u2019ll be judged, but I thought within the process \u2026 our preparation was as good as it has been all year long.\u201d</p>\n",

Illinois went on a 10-1 run in the fourth, including a three from Parchment, to take a late four-point lead.</p>\n<p><strong><em>[<a href=\"https://dbknews.com/2025/12/29/maryland-womens-basketball-score-recap-result-wisconsin-3/\">Oluchi Okananwa scores career-high as Maryland women\u2019s basketball destroys Wisconsin, 97-59</a>]</em></strong></p>\n<p>Maryland (14-1, 2-1 Big Ten) committed five turnovers in the final quarter \u2014 which Frese called \u201cimpactful.\u201d Saylor Poffenbarger passed to Garzon, cutting to the net, who let the ball fall out of bounds for Maryland\u2019s fourth turnover of the period.</p>\n<p>The Terps still shot nearly 43 percent in the fourth, but couldn\u2019t deliver on key shots. The group missed all their 3-point attempts in the final 10 minutes, and Poffenbarger missed two free throws.</p>\n<p>Poffenbarger had a chance to tie the game with a 3-pointer with eight seconds left.</p>\n<p>But the redshirt senior, who finished with 15 points and six assists, couldn\u2019t nail her third attempt of the night to force overtime.</p>\n<p>The Terps only had one close game this season before Thursday: a 100-99 double-overtime win over Minnesota. Illinois (13-1, 3-0 Big Ten) entered undefeated since Nov. 14.</p>\n<p>The Illini boasted just one previous win over Maryland with a one-point victory at Xfinity Center last season. Fourth-year coach Shauna Green has turned around a historically poor Illinois team \u2014 leading them to a winning record the past three seasons.</p>\n<p><strong><em>[<a href=\"https://dbknews.com/2025/12/27/maryland-football-zahir-mathis-sidney-stewart-return/\">Zahir Mathis, Sidney Stewart to return to Maryland football in 2026</a>]</em></strong></p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Frese said a goal was to take away Illinois\u2019 size.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe disappointing thing on my end is the lack of discipline in regards to some of the things we wanted to do scout wise,\u201d Frese said.</p>\n<p>Maryland\u2019s season-long turnover struggles persisted early. Offensive production and strong full-court press disguised Maryland\u2019s 20 turnovers against Wisconsin the game prior \u2014 a total Frese said was a personnel issue for her team on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Three days later, the Terps finished with 18 turnovers.</p>\n<p>Oluchi Okananwa turned it over multiple times in the opening minutes and Saylor Poffenbarger committed back-to-back turnovers in 11 seconds. Maryland held a one-point lead after committing six turnovers in the first five minutes.</p>\n<p>First-half turnovers and foul trouble limited Maryland\u2019s lead to five at half. The Terps\u2019 scoring faltered from there. Okananwa \u2014 the Terps\u2019 leading scorer \u2014 didn\u2019t register a point in the second half, the team failed to make a 3-pointer and notched only four assists.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t play our basketball for enough time in this game,\u201d Garzon said.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Maryland women\u2019s basketball has found itself a new duo.</p>\n<p>Oluchi Okananwa and Saylor Poffenbarger combined for 42 points, nine rebounds and nine steals as Maryland dominated the Badgers, 97-59, Monday in its Big Ten home opener.</p>\n<p>The win gave the Terps their second consecutive 14-0 start to a season.</p>\n<p>Okananwa posted career-highs of 28 points and six steals in just 20 minutes. The Duke transfer has gone from a sixth woman role with the Blue Devils to the top scorer with Maryland.</p>\n<p>\u201cI&#8217;m a pretty intense player, if you guys didn\u2019t know,&#8221; Okananwa said. &#8220;It was easy to lead with that and just feeding off my teammates.\u201d</p>\n<p>The junior averaged 15.5 points before Monday\u2019s matchup at Xfinity Center, which was tied for No. 12 in the Big Ten. That rank is sure to rise after draining 10 field goals on 15 shots and adding five makes at the free throw line.</p>\n<p>Okananwa, despite standing just 5-foot-10, is also separating herself as a rebounder. She grabbed four boards within the first five minutes against the Badgers.</p>\n<p>The guard said earlier in the season that she\u2019s taken Frese\u2019s rebounding emphasis personally and has strived to be a leader in that category.</p>\n<p>Poffenbarger, who was honored before the game for reaching 1000 career points, came out strong in her first appearance in 22 days. The senior missed the past two contests amid what Frese called a \u201cplanned rest period\u201d for an ankle injury.</p>\n<p><strong><em>[<a href=\"https://dbknews.com/2025/12/28/maryland-mens-basketball-score-recap-result-old-dominion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Maryland men\u2019s basketball\u2019s new-look starting lineup beats Old Dominion, 73-58</a>]</em></strong></p>\n<p>Poffenbarger has gained serious attention as a potential 2026 WNBA draft prospect. The Middletown native posted 30 points and 10 rebounds in Maryland\u2019s double overtime win against Minnesota, the same day Kaylene Smikle announced she would forfeit the season to undergo knee surgery.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere&#8217;s really not much that, if you ask [Poffenbarger], she can&#8217;t do,\u201d Okananwa said. \u201cShe\u2019s a great leader.\u201d</p>\n<p>Poffenbarger used her physicality well Monday, swatting away a 3-point attempt from leading Badgers scorer Kyrah Daniels with ease. Two plays later, Poffenbarger dove under the basket to secure an offensive rebound. She finished with 14 points.</p>\n<p>Much of the Badgers\u2019 struggles was the result of lackluster rebounding. The Terps outpaced them 16-3 in the first quarter, with seven of them coming on the offensive glass. Maryland grabbed 51 rebounds for the game and scored 20 second-chance points off 20 offensive rebounds.</p>\n<p>The Terps rank second in the Big Ten in rebounding average, just behind UCLA. Isimenme Ozzy-Momodu and Mir McLean paced them on Monday with nine and eight, respectively.</p>\n<p><strong><em>[<a href=\"https://dbknews.com/2025/12/27/maryland-football-zahir-mathis-sidney-stewart-return/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zahir Mathis, Sidney Stewart to return to Maryland football in 2026</a>]</em></strong></p>\n<p>Maryland took advantage of a tinier Wisconsin roster. Ronnie Porter, the Badgers\u2019 5-foot-2 point guard, was swamped by Maryland\u2019s height and scored just three points. It took Wisconsin over five minutes to crack the Terps\u2019 press and put up its first points.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought going into the game, we understood the kind of pressure that we were going to face with their full court,\u201d Badgers coach Robin Pingeton said. \u201cUntil you actually face it, it&#8217;s different.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wisconsin came into the night on a three-game win streak, including an upset over No. 20 Michigan State. The Badgers remained unable to top the Terps, dropping to 0-15 in the matchup\u2019s history.</p>\n<p>Maryland has remained at No. 7 in the AP poll since Nov. 24. The Terps have picked up additional quality wins since against Big Ten foe Minnesota and then-No. 16 Kentucky, but haven\u2019t been rewarded.</p>\n<p>The end of the Terps\u2019 nonconference slate was also noncompetitive, though. They blew out Hofstra, Mount St. Mary\u2019s, Delaware State and Connecticut State between Nov. 27 and Dec. 19, with the Minnesota game sandwiched between.</p>\n<p>Despite Maryland losing three players for the season since late November, the team hasn\u2019t lost a beat. The duo of Okananwa and Poffenbarger filled the gap on Monday, evolving into a serious threat as Big Ten play picks up.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of scary to think how good they could be if they were healthy,\u201d Pingeton said.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Isaiah Watts\u2019 first two months with Maryland men\u2019s basketball didn\u2019t go as planned.</p>\n<p>The Washington State transfer was touted as one of coach Buzz Williams\u2019 biggest shooting assets. But the 6-foot-3 junior consistently saw shots clank off the rim in his first 11 games.</p>\n<p>He shot 32.7 percent from the field and 27 percent on 3-pointers entering Sunday\u2019s clash against Old Dominion. Both were career-lows by more than six percent.</p>\n<p>Williams, searching for answers amid a .500 start, gave Watts his first start of the season. Early minutes translated into consistent results. The junior guard scored all 17 of his points before halftime, providing the Terps a lead they never relinquished in a 73-58 win over the Monarchs.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were getting really good one-pass threes, extra-pass threes, touching the paint, kick-out threes,\u201d Watts said, \u201cIn the second half, it wasn\u2019t as much of that. \u2026 But sometimes, they just don\u2019t fall the way you want them to. Trust me, I know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Williams\u2019 seventh starting group this year looked like the best one he\u2019s played in the first half.</p>\n<p>Maryland (7-6) scored the first 17 points of the contest \u2014 its best stretch to open a game since January 2003. Williams trotted out Watts alongside redshirt freshman guard Andre Mills, freshman guard Darius Adams, senior forward Solomon Washington and senior forward Elijah Saunders.</p>\n<p>Williams has often opted for early substitutions this season \u2014 a strategy that didn\u2019t answer inconsistent offense.</p>\n<p>But Sunday, he kept his starters in for more than six minutes to begin the contest. The group, despite lacking a true point guard, outscored Old Dominion (4-10), 27-5, in the opening period.</p>\n<p><em><strong>[<a href=\"https://dbknews.com/2025/12/15/maryland-mens-basketball-buzz-williams-process-mindset/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Buzz Williams preaches process over results amid Maryland men\u2019s basketball\u2019s rough stretch</a>]</strong></em></p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying that group is the answer, but that group did accumulate more turkeys and more assists with less turnovers than any other group that we have played,\u201d Williams said. \u201cSo that\u2019s a good start.\u201d</p>\n<p>The lineup\u2019s lead ballhandlers, Mills and Adams, are the two best drivers on the team. They also offer a physical presence at the top of Maryland\u2019s press defense, and Watts adds an element of shooting the team has lacked.</p>\n<p>The guard trio combined for 39 of the Terps\u2019 45 first-half points. Watts accounted for 37 percent of Maryland\u2019s offense in the opening period, while Mills and Adams each added 11 points on three made triples. But Watts and Mills went scoreless in a cold second half, while Adams finished with 18 points on 6-for-16 shooting.</p>\n<p>Forced to adapt without injured forward Pharrel Payne, the Terps ran a \u201c5-out\u201d offense while placing a heavy emphasis on ball movement and perimeter spacing.</p>\n<p>Two staples of a Williams-led group typically involve dominating at the free throw line and on the offensive glass. But missing Payne\u2019s 6-foot-9 frame, Maryland shot less free throws and grabbed less offensive rebounds than Old Dominion, who KenPom ranked in the nation\u2019s bottom-150 of both metrics entering Sunday.</p>\n<p>Instead, the Terps built an advantage from beyond the arc, knocking down 11 3-pointers to Old Dominion\u2019s three. They also recorded 12 first-half assists and tied their season-low of eight turnovers, helping their Big Ten-low 0.79 assist-to-turnover ratio.</p>\n<p><em><strong>[<a href=\"https://dbknews.com/2025/12/20/familiar-issues-plague-maryland-mens-basketball-in-80-72-loss-to-no-23-virginia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Familiar issues plague Maryland men\u2019s basketball in 80-72 loss to No. 23 Virginia</a>]</strong></em></p>\n<p>The early cushion was needed.</p>\n<p>Maryland shot 10-for-19 on first-half threes before converting just 1-for-9 in the second frame. The Terps scored just 28 points after the break, shot 34.5 percent and were outscored by 12.</p>\n<p>Sunday marked Maryland\u2019s final \u201cbuy game\u201d \u2014 or matchup against a non-power conference opponent \u2014 before resuming Big Ten play. The 15-point victory continued a trend of Williams\u2019 group beating up against lower-level opponents.</p>\n<p>The Terps outscored their previous four mid-major opponents by a combined 73 points. The struggles for Maryland have come against more stout programs \u2014 its posted a -120 point differential against its first six high-major opponents, plus No. 7 Gonzaga.</p>\n<p>The Terps have many more future opponents like those than like Old Dominion. Now the question is: Will any of Sunday\u2019s positive results translate?</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be different in Big Ten play,\u201d Adams said. \u201cWe\u2019re not happy about how this went, but we\u2019re definitely going to learn from it.\u201d</p>\n",
