      "    \"rendered\": \"<p>Sacha Llanto said one of the longest weeks of his life was when his friend, Chantal Anicoche, went missing in the Philippines after a military attack.</p>\\n<p>Anicoche, a University of Maryland, Baltimore County alum, was conducting humanitarian work when the Armed Forces of the Philippines conducted bombings in Abra de Ilog, Occidental Mindoro on Jan. 1, according to a petition circulated by the Action Network. Anicoche was missing for about a week before resurfacing in media reports \\u2014 she was held in military custody for almost a month before returning to the U.S. at the end of January amid pressure from advocacy groups.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt was really about keeping the spirits up, about knowing that she was alive and knowing that she\\u2019ll come home eventually,\\u201d Llanto, a senior public health science major and a member of Filipino advocacy organization Kabataan Alliance DMV, told The Diamondback.</p>\\n<p>A recently passed University of Maryland Student Government Association resolution will call for an independent investigation into the source of weapons used in the Jan. 1 Philippines attack and urges the University System of Maryland to audit holdings in companies that allegedly supplied helicopters and missiles to the Philippines\\u2019 armed forces.</p>\\n<p><em><strong>[<a href=\\\"https://dbknews.com/2026/02/12/umd-sga-university-system-maryland-divesment-resolution/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">UMD SGA resolution calls on USM to divest from weapons companies</a>]</strong></em></p>\\n<p>The Armed Forces of the Philippines deployed four attack helicopters and dropped at least 12 aerial bombs, which killed at least three children and two student researchers, according to the Action Network.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnicoche went to the Philippines to learn directly from the Mangyan community about their issues and aspirations, especially in the face of economic hardship and environmental degradation,\\u201d the petition for Anicoche\\u2019s release read.</p>\\n<p>The SGA resolution passed 19-0-1 on Wednesday. It also calls for this university and the university system\\u2019s Board of Regents to protect student organizations\\u2019 freedom of expression and condemn the terror-tagging of human rights organizations, or labeling people as terrorists without evidence.</p>\\n<p>Resolution sponsor Zyad Khan said this university, the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and the university system offered no support when Anicoche was missing in the Philippines.</p>\\n<p>Khan, an SGA representative for the computer, mathematical, and natural sciences college, said the bill calls for accountability from the entire university system for the \\u201cradio silence\\u201d about Anicoche\\u2019s disappearance. The senior computer science major said the attack is an example of how U.S.-made weapons are used to \\u201cmurder and genocide innocent people.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Wednesday\\u2019s resolution urges this university to disassociate from any weapon systems that facilitate human rights violations in the Philippines and elsewhere in the world. This principle is tied to the <a href=\\\"https://dbknews.com/2026/02/12/umd-sga-university-system-maryland-divesment-resolution/\\\">divestment resolution</a> SGA passed last week, according to Khan.</p>\\n<p>This university said in a statement to The Diamondback that resolutions voted on by SGA are student-led and reflect perspectives of voting members. The university has previously told The Diamondback that SGA resolutions have no bearing influence on the university\\u2019s actions.</p>\\n<p>Gabriel Pasion, vice chairperson for Anakbayan College Park and a university alum, said understanding the relationship between this university and these defense companies goes back to the importance of divesting.</p>\\n<p>Now that Anicoche has been released, Pasion said local advocacy groups have been building a united front of community-led organizations. Anicoche, along with the organization she was working with, has been terror-tagged by the Philippine military, Pasion said.</p>\\n<p><b><em><strong>[<a href=\\\"https://dbknews.com/2026/02/13/umd-discovery-house-graduate-affordability/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">UMD graduate students concerned about affordability of new graduate housing complex</a>]</strong></em></b></p>\\n<p>Many of these organizations have helped Filipinos in the diaspora reconnect with their homes, history and culture, according to Pasion.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s not a crime to do that,\\u201d Pasion said.</p>\\n<p>Llanto said Anicoche went back to the Philippines to learn more about what indigenous people, who are impacted by environmental issues the most, are going through.</p>\\n<p>Llanto, who said Anicoche was also a part of the Kabataan Alliance DMV, said the main mission of the alliance is to educate, unite and help Filipino youth fight for their rights.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re not scared of being red tagged and such,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe do believe in what we do to help the youth \\u2014 educate the youth \\u2014 is necessary as Filipino Americans in the diaspora, and to also help those back home.\\u201d</p>\\n\",\n",
